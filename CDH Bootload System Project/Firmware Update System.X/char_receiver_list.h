 * The @c char Receiver List module provides a simple way of keeping
 * a list of character receivers and processing a single character
 * through the receivers.
 *
 * This module was developed as a helper to the @ref uart UART Module
 * but it has use in any situation where multiple moldules may want
 * to process characters which are received.
